 Spring Boot is a powerful framework for building microservices in Java. Here's how you can approach implementing your requirements using Spring Boot:
Steps:

1. Create a Spring Boot Project**: Use Spring Initializr or Maven to create a new Spring Boot project. Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database (for in-memory storage), and Spring Boot DevTools (for hot reloading during development).

2. Define Entity**: Create a Student entity class with fields for roll number, student name, science, maths, English, computer, and eligibility status.

3. CSV Upload Endpoint**: Implement a controller with an endpoint for uploading CSV files. Use `@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile` to handle file uploads.

4. CSV Processing Service**: Write a service to parse the CSV file, process student records based on eligibility criteria, and update the eligibility status.

5. Eligibility Criteria Endpoint**: Implement an endpoint to dynamically update eligibility criteria. You can store criteria in a properties file or database and provide an API to modify them.

6. Search Endpoint**: Create an endpoint to search for students by roll number. Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the in-memory database/cache.

7. Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for your service methods and controllers using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.

8. Swagger Documentation**: Integrate Swagger UI with Spring Boot using libraries like Springfox or Springdoc OpenAPI. Annotate your controllers with Swagger annotations to generate API documentation.

9. README**: Provide clear instructions in your README for setting up and running the application, using the API endpoints, and any other relevant information.

### Sample Code:


// Student.java (Entity)
@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    private String rollNumber;
    private String name;
    private int science;
    private int maths;
    private int english;
    private int computer;
    private String eligibilityStatus;
    // getters and setters
}

// StudentService.java
@Service
public class StudentService {
    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository studentRepository;
    public void processCsv(MultipartFile file) {
        // CSV processing logic
    }
    public void updateEligibilityCriteria(Criteria criteria) {
        // Update eligibility criteria logic
    }
    public Student findByRollNumber(String rollNumber) {
        // Find student by roll number logic
    }
}

// StudentController.java
@RestController
public class StudentController {
    @Autowired
    private StudentService studentService;
    @PostMapping("/upload")
    public ResponseEntity<?> uploadCsv(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
        // Handle CSV upload
    }
    @PutMapping("/criteria")
    public ResponseEntity<?> updateCriteria(@RequestBody Criteria criteria) {
        // Update eligibility criteria
    }
    @GetMapping("/student/{rollNumber}")
    public ResponseEntity<?> getStudent(@PathVariable String rollNumber) {
        // Get student by roll number
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:

With Spring Boot, you can easily build a robust microservice-based API for student scholarship eligibility. Follow the steps outlined above, and don't forget to write unit tests, provide thorough documentation, and ensure proper logging for a complete and reliable solution.
